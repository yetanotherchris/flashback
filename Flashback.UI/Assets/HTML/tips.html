	<h1>Tips for effective learning</h1>

	<p>
	The effectiveness that you learn a topic depends primarily on how interested you are in it. You need to understand the topic first in order 
	for it to become meaningful and subsequently be learnt. There are various ways you can recall something you’ve learnt - being asked to 
	recall it with no help, being given a cue (e.g. what is a president’s name beginning with G), given a list of items to learn, and 
	associating a cue with the item you want to remember, a technique used by some of the memory systems described below.
	</p>

	<p>
	Even when you think you have completely forgotten a subject, going back and relearning the topic will be faster than learning it from new.</p>

	<h3>Familiarity</h3>
	<p>
	As mentioned, the more interested and familiar you are in the topic the easier it will be to recall it. As you become more familiar with a topic, 
	learning new material for the topic becomes easier.
	</p> 

	<p>
		The first and easiest tip in helping to remember a question and answer is to make both of them meaningful. Use rhymes, patterns and mnemonics to make the content easier to recall. One example of 
		using patterns is with number chunking. Chunking numbers into blocks of 3 - turning 157230941 into 157-230-941 - helps you 
	remember a longer number. Ffor most people, 7 digits is the maximum you can recall without this technique). This 
	chunking system can be used beyond numbers to simplify long answers into smaller, more manageable parts. 
	</p>

	<h3>Order</h3>
	<p>
	The order you learn items determines how easily you memorise and recall them. Items at the front and end of lists have been shown to be 
	easier to learn and recall than those in the middle. So put the more complicated and/or important subjects, words and phrases at the start or end of a category.
	</p>

	<h3>Association</h3>
	<p>
	Association is simply associated the word you want to remember with something else. One example of this is word play, for example "Queue you ee you ee" 
	is used to remember the spelling of queue. 
		<br />
		<br />
		Associating an image or imagery with an item is another form of association and as a memory technique is centuries old. For example picturing an elf for the German number 11 (which is elf).
	</p>

	<h3>Mnemonic systems</h3>
	<p>
	There are a fair number of mnemonic systems that most memory books will teach. These include:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Link system</li>
		<li>Story system</li>
		<li>Loci system</li>
		<li>Peg system</li>
		<li>1st letter mnemonic</li>
		<li>Keyword mnemonics</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Any memory book will cover these in a lot of detail, below is a brief summary of each type.
	</p>

	<h3>Link system</h3>
	<p>
	The link system is effective for lists of items, that are in order. The idea is you associate an image for the first item in the list, 
	and then tie that image into the next image you&#39;ve associated and so on, all the way through the list. The system relies on the items being easy to associate with a visual element. For example with the list Scissors, Book, Bottle, you could think of a pair of scissors cutting up a book with a bottle on top of the book.
	</p>

	<h3>Story system</h3>
	<p>
	This is a variation of the link system, and involves taking the items in your list and producing a story from them. It’s very 
	effective for serial learning of lists, speeches, and learning words (in order) in a foreign language. As stories can incorporate more abstract 
	concepts, this is a more flexible system than the link system. Try making a story with 5 random objects and you will see how powerful it can be.</p>

	<h3>Loci system</h3>
	<p>
	This is an ancient mnemonic system that involves picturing the items you want to remember in a location that is familiar for you. 
	For example associate or place the item you are trying to remember in your kitchen. Then the next item in the bathroom and so on. 
		In order to recall the items, picture yourself going amongst the various rooms you have used. You can place multiple items in the same room and up to 10 locations work effectively. Combined with the link or story systems, Loci becomes even more powerful.
	</p>

	<h3>1st letter mnemonic</h3>
	<p>
	This is something you will have used at some point in your life. It includes acronyms, acrostics (an acronym as a poem), verses and rhymes. 
	This combines the power of chunking, described earlier with familiarity through patterns, and helps recall by embedding clues.
		There are many ones learnt at school, for example Bless Dear Aunt Sally - Brackets, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.</p>

	<h3>Keyword mnemonics</h3>
	<p>
	This works on the imagery technique described earlier. The system is simple: you take a concrete noun (an object you can remember easily) which sounds familiar 
	to the word you are trying to remember and think of that of that when trying to recall the word. It is a particularly effective system for learning foreign languages. So for example, the French 
	for house is Maison. You could use a mason as the noun, and think of him building a house.
	</p>

	<h3>Peg system</h3>
	<p>
	The Link, Loci and Story systems are great if you are learning items in a set order. However if you want to recall the items at 
	randomly remembering their position in the list, the Peg system is more effective. It works in two steps. The first step is to learn a set of 
	words that are associated with the numbers 1-10 (this can also be extended to 20). These words are traditionally 
	1 - bun, 2 - shoe, 3 - tree, 4 - door, 5 - hive, 6 - sticks, 7 - heaven, 8 - gate, 9 - wine, 10 - hen, but there are also variations. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Step 2 involves associating the word or item you want to remember with one of these words. For example if you want to remember 
	the word "chicken" at position 8, you would think of a chicken sat at a gate.
	</p>

	<h2>Nutrition</h2>

	<p>
	Along with the techniques described above, you can help memorise and recall items through minor changes to 
	what you eat, through exercise and taking a few supplements each day.
	</p>

	<h3>Exercise</h3>
	<p>
	This is one of the most obvious and easiest ways to help the learning process. A small amount of exercise (preferably raising the heart rate) 
	has been shown in countless studies to improve memory and mental function, and also stabilises your mood.
	</p>

	<h3>Food types and metabolism</h3>
	<p>
	Eating small, regular meals rather than large meals helps to increase your metabolism. Whilst this is the prime goal of dieting, 
	it also helps you stay sharp and alert for exams, tests or whatever situation you need to recall the material you have learnt. 
	Avoiding excess sugar, simple carbohydrates and sticking to low GL foods also provide similar benefits. A simplified explanation of GL, or Glycemic load, 
	is the speed at which the food provides energy over a period of time. High fat and refined sugary food will give you a short insulin and energy rush 
	but then is subsequently followed by a slump. A wealth of information on GL (and more thorough explanations) is available online.
	</p>

	<h3>Alcohol</h3>
	<p>
	It is well established that alcohol "makes you stupid". The urban myth that alcohol kills brain cells isn’t that far from the truth - 
	it interferes with the effectiveness of various vitamins and minerals, the digestive enzymes in your stomach, dissolves fatty acids 
	used by the brain and is also high in calories (the same amount per gramme as fat). Stay clear or reduce your alcohol intake when you need to memorise and recall a topic.</p>

	<h3>Vitamin B</h3>
	<p>
	The Vitamin B group of vitamins are one of 2 water soluble vitamins. This means any excess you take is is simply removed in the urine. 
	Many of the range of vitamins in the Vitamin B group play an essential role in metabolising carbohydrates and protein, and some 
	studies have shown its effectiveness in improving memory and reducing stress, and combating age-related brain degenerative illnesses 
	and mental illnesses. Taking a supplement with the RDA of Vitamin B group of vitamins, preferably after a meal can help you stay alert. 
	You can also find B1-B6 in vegetables, wholegrains, Folic acid (B9) in leafy vegetables and B12 in meat and fish.
	</p>

	<h3>Omega 3 and 6</h3>
	<p>
	There have been a range of studies showing that 
		supplementing the fatty acids Omega 3 and 6 helps to improve memory and brain function and also reduce the risk of dementia in later life. 
	The best source of Omega 3 is oily fish, eaten three times a week. Omega 6 provides the brain with the fatty acid GLA and can be found in abundence in Evening primrose oil. The studies recommending supplementing the fatty acids EPA and DHA (Omega 3) with 200mg a day, and GLA (Omega 6) 100mg.</p>
